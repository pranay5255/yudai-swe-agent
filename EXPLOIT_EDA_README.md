uv run jupyter lab
```

## 📁 Files Created

- `exploit_results_eda.ipynb` - Main analysis notebook
- `run_eda_notebook.sh` - Quick launch script
- `exploit_results/benchmark_summary.csv` - Exported summary data (created when you run the notebook)

## 📦 Dependencies

All required packages have been installed:
- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib` - Plotting and visualization
- `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization
- `jupyter` - Interactive notebook environment
- `notebook` - Jupyter notebook interface

## 📈 Key Insights from Current Data

Based on the analysis of 28 benchmark files:

- **Total Cases**: 28 cases executed across multiple runs
- **Models Tested**: 3 models (deepseek/deepseek-v3.2, google/gemini-3-flash-preview, moonshotai/kimi-k2.5)
- **Chains**: 2 blockchains (mainnet, bsc)
- **Status**: Most runs were interrupted (78.6%), with 21.4% completed
- **Common Errors**: KeyboardInterrupt (manual stops), OpenRouterAuthenticationError, RuntimeError
- **Duration Range**: 8.17s to 1713.31s (mean: 484.12s)

## 🔍 Using the Notebook

1. Open the notebook using one of the methods above
2. Run all cells sequentially using `Cell > Run All` or run them individually
3. Explore the visualizations and statistics
4. Modify or add new analysis cells as needed
5. The last cell exports a CSV summary to `exploit_results/benchmark_summary.csv`

## 🛠️ Customization

You can easily extend the analysis by:

1. Adding new visualization types
2. Creating custom filters for specific models or chains
3. Adding correlation analysis
4. Implementing statistical tests
5. Creating interactive visualizations with plotly

## 📝 Notes

- The notebook reads all JSON files from the `exploit_results/` directory
- Trajectory (`.traj.json`) and result (`.result.json`) files are automatically excluded
- Data is automatically preprocessed and cleaned
- All visualizations are generated dynamically from the current data

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Module not found**: Run `uv add <module-name>` to install missing packages
2. **Notebook won't start**: Check that you're in the correct directory
3. **Data not loading**: Verify that `exploit_results/` contains JSON files
4. **Plots not showing**: Make sure `%matplotlib inline` is executed

Enjoy exploring your exploit results!
