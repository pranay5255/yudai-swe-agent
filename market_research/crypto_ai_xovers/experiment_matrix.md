# Experiment Matrix - Crypto x AI Crossovers

Scoring uses 1 (low) to 5 (high). These are directional and should be refined with real customer data.

| ID | Use case | Application | Core user | Repo fit | Speed to MVP | Distribution leverage | Revenue clarity | TAM range | SAM range | Low-cost GTM experiment | Key risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Persistent context | Audit Context Passport | Protocol security lead | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | $150M-$3.5B | $45M-$1.75B | Ship context import/export + 5 sample capsules | Context leakage or bad assumptions |
| 2 | Agent identity | Security Agent Passport | Audit firms, tool vendors | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | $20M-$500M | $6M-$200M | Verified agent badge in GitHub PRs | Needs multi-platform adoption |
| 3 | Proof of personhood | PoP-verified bounties | Bounty managers | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | $500M-$2B | $50M-$500M | PoP required for high-value bounties | PoP adoption friction |
| 4 | DePIN compute | Decentralized fuzzing network | Protocol security teams | 4 | 2 | 2 | 4 | $30M-$1.4B | $9M-$560M | Fuzzing burst pilot with 3-5 teams | Verification of compute |
| 5 | Agent guardrails | Onchain workflow guardrails | Enterprises, audit firms | 4 | 3 | 2 | 4 | $40M-$750M | $12M-$225M | Open-source guardrail spec + pilot | Policy complexity |
| 6 | Sync layer | Security standards sync | Dev teams, template maintainers | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | $50M-$1B | $15M-$400M | GitHub Action drift report | Governance of standards |
| 7 | Micropayments | Security revenue splits | Open-source contributors | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | $150M-$3B | $30M-$1.2B | Sponsor-a-rule campaign | Attribution disputes |
| 8 | IP registry | Audit report provenance | Audit firms, researchers | 4 | 3 | 2 | 3 | $300M-$2B | $30M-$400M | Publish registry with 1 partner | IP ownership ambiguity |
| 9 | Paid crawlers | Paid crawl for docs | Protocol docs owners | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | $500M-$5B | $5M-$250M | Pilot with 5-10 protocols | Adoption by doc owners |
| 10 | Privacy ads | Opt-in tool recommendations | Dev tools vendors | 3 | 3 | 2 | 3 | $1B-$5B | $20M-$250M | 3 vendor opt-in pilot | Regulatory + trust risk |
| 11 | AI companions | Security mentor companion | Web3 developers | 5 | 4 | 4 | 3 | $1B-$5B | $50M-$500M | Free CLI mentor + weekly challenges | Retention beyond novelty |

## Suggested validation order (fast signal, high repo fit)
1. Persistent context (ID 1)
2. AI companion for security training (ID 11)
3. Sync layer for security standards (ID 6)
4. PoP-verified bounties (ID 3)
5. Micropayment revenue splits (ID 7)

## Notes
- TAM/SAM ranges are directional; update with sourced data when available.
- If you want a narrower plan, pick a single distribution surface (CLI, GitHub app, or mini-app) and focus all experiments there.
